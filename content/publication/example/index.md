abstract: "We develop a Bayesian approach called the Bayesian projected
  calibration to address the problem of calibrating an imperfect computer model
  using observational data from an unknown complex physical system. The
  calibration parameter and the physical system are parameterized in an
  identifiable fashion via the L2-projection. The physical system is imposed a
  Gaussian process prior distribution, which naturally induces a prior
  distribution on the calibration parameter through the L2-projection
  constraint. The calibration parameter is estimated through its posterior
  distribution, serving as a natural and nonasymptotic approach for the
  uncertainty quantification. We provide rigorous large sample justifications of
  the proposed approach by establishing the asymptotic normality of the
  posterior of the calibration parameter with the efficient covariance matrix.
  In addition to the theoretical analysis, two convenient computational
  algorithms based on stochastic approximation are designed with strong
  theoretical support. Through extensive simulation studies and the analyses of
  two real-world datasets, we show that the proposed Bayesian projected
  calibration can accurately estimate the calibration parameters, calibrate the
  computer models well, and compare favorably to alternative approaches. "
