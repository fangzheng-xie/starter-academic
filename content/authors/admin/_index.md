I am an assistant professor in the Department of Statistics at Indiana University. I am broadly interested in developing Bayesian methods for various statistical problems with strong theoretical support. Specifically, I have been focusing on Bayes theory and methods for network data and high-dimensional problems, nonparametric Bayes, and Bayesian methods for computer experiments and uncertainty quantification. On the application side, I am also interested in designing new Bayesian methods for computational biology.

I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics at Johns Hopkins University under the supervision of Dr. Yanxun Xu.
